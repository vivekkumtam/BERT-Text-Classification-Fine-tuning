# BERT Text Classification Fine-tuning

## Overview
This project involves fine-tuning a BERT model for text classification using a dataset from Hugging Face. The goal is to train the BERT model on the chosen dataset, evaluate its performance, analyze the predictions, and demonstrate the model's ability to capture contextual embeddings.

## Project Structure
- `bert_finetune.py`: Python script for fine-tuning the BERT model, evaluating it, and generating the required outputs.
- `report.pdf`: Detailed report including the dataset description, BERT model details, network architecture, results, and analysis.
- `dataset/`: Folder containing the text classification dataset (if it is not available for download via the Hugging Face library).

## Instructions

### 1. Setup Environment
To run the project, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them via `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
